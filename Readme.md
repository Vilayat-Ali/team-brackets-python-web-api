## What is Team Brackets?
Team Brackets is a team of talented students who strive hard to make a position into some of the most difficult internation hackathons. 
Initially started with three student members (founding members) in around the mid of 2021:
- Syed Vilayat Ali Rizvi
- Pritesh Dash
- Syed Mohd Abbas Zaidi

After success in secure good positions in multiple national and international hackathons, the founders wanted to go for a solid team chemistry 
with more young hackers to join and make awesome projects for such events.
